# some code projects

Looking for existing Java projects that students can hack on to get better at Just Coding.

TextEditor "works" not all the things implemented; could be part of the lab.

The civilization game is kinda mind blowing.
It works, takes over the entire screen and somehow...well run it and see

The Airways thing is a mess; needs a modern database

Payroll needs a modern database

neither Pongs work.

All code was simply `javac *.java; java "mainclasswhatever"`
